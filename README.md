Based on the repository content you've shared and the LangGraph use cases we've developed (011-020), I can provide an enhanced structure that integrates both approaches. Here's a refined version:

# LangChain and LangGraph Hands-on Tutorial and Case Studies

A comprehensive learning path covering both LangChain and LangGraph, featuring 100+ practical implementations progressing from basic concepts to advanced agent architectures.

## Overview

This repository provides a structured approach to learning modern LLM application development using both LangChain and LangGraph frameworks. The collection begins with fundamental concepts and gradually progresses to complex, specialized agent implementations and graph-based workflows. It serves as both an educational resource and a reference for implementing AI agents in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of Python and API concepts

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-tutorial.git
   cd langchain-tutorial
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install common dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-community langgraph python-dotenv
   ```

4. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Learning Path

### Part 1: Getting Started with LangChain

#### Step 1: Basic LLM Usage (`step1.py`)
Learn to interact with OpenAI's LLM using LangChain:
- Setting up the environment
- Creating an LLM instance
- Sending basic prompts and receiving responses

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Create OpenAI LLM instance
llm = OpenAI()

# Query the LLM
prompt = "What's the weather like today?"
response = llm.invoke(prompt)

print("LLM Response:")
print(response)
```

#### Step 2: Multi-Tool Agent Implementation (`step2.py`)
Build a more advanced LangChain agent with multiple tools:
- Calculator for mathematical operations
- Current time retrieval
- Web search using DuckDuckGo
