# Use Case 018: Parallel Processing with LangGraph

This use case demonstrates how to implement parallel execution of tasks in a LangGraph application to improve efficiency when handling independent operations.

## Overview

This example shows how to:
1. Split a task into parallel workstreams
2. Execute multiple operations concurrently
3. Aggregate results from parallel processes
4. Orchestrate parallel and sequential operations

## Implementation

The implementation shows a research system that:
- Divides a research question into multiple sub-questions
- Researches each sub-question in parallel
- Aggregates and synthesizes the findings
- Creates a comprehensive answer

## Requirements

```
langgraph>=0.0.10
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.0.2
```

## Usage

```python
python main.py "What factors influence renewable energy adoption in urban areas?"
```

## Key Concepts

- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into parallel sub-tasks
- **Concurrent Execution**: Processing multiple workstreams simultaneously
- **Result Aggregation**: Combining parallel outputs coherently
- **Thread Management**: Coordinating parallel operations efficiently
