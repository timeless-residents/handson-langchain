# Use Case 014: Multi-Agent Collaboration with LangGraph

This use case demonstrates how to implement a multi-agent system using LangGraph, where specialized agents work together to solve a complex problem.

## Overview

Building on previous use cases, this example introduces:

1. Multiple specialized agents with different roles
2. Agent communication and coordination
3. State sharing between agents
4. Role-based task division

## Implementation

This implementation shows a collaborative system with four specialized agents:
1. **Researcher**: Gathers and organizes information 
2. **Analyst**: Processes information and identifies patterns
3. **Critic**: Evaluates solutions and identifies weaknesses
4. **Synthesizer**: Combines insights into a cohesive final solution

## Requirements

```
langgraph>=0.0.10
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.0.2
```

## Usage

```python
python main.py "What are the most promising approaches to carbon sequestration?"
```

## Key Concepts

- **Agent Specialization**: Designing agents for specific roles
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Coordinating between agents
- **Shared State**: Maintaining and updating a common state
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Effective division of cognitive labor
