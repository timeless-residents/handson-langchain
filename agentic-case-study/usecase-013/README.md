# Use Case 013: Iterative Refinement with LangGraph

This use case demonstrates how to implement iterative loops in LangGraph for problems that require multiple passes of refinement until a satisfactory solution is reached.

## Overview

Building on previous use cases, this example introduces:

1. Cyclic execution paths (loops)
2. Conditional termination
3. Solution refinement through multiple iterations
4. Self-assessment of solution quality

## Implementation

This implementation shows a reasoning agent that:
1. Solves an initial version of a problem
2. Checks if the solution meets quality criteria
3. If not, refines the solution iteratively
4. Terminates when a high-quality solution is achieved

## Requirements

```
langgraph>=0.0.10
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.0.2
```

## Usage

```python
python main.py "Write a function to find the longest palindromic substring in a string."
```

## Key Concepts

- **Cycles**: Creating loops in the graph through cyclic edges
- **Termination Conditions**: Determining when to exit a loop
- **State History**: Tracking changes across iterations
- **Iterative Improvement**: Gradually refining results
