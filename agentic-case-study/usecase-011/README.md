# Use Case 011: Simple LangGraph Introduction

This use case demonstrates a basic implementation of LangGraph for building an agent that can solve simple reasoning problems.

## Overview

LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain for creating stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. This example introduces the fundamental components of LangGraph:

1. Creating a basic state graph
2. Defining nodes for reasoning steps
3. Connecting nodes with edges
4. Executing the graph

## Implementation

This implementation shows a basic reasoning agent that:
1. Breaks down a problem
2. Solves each part
3. Assembles the final answer

## Requirements

```
langgraph>=0.0.10
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.0.2
```

## Usage

```python
python main.py "What is the sum of the first 10 prime numbers?"
```

## Key Concepts

- **State**: The graph's memory that persists between steps
- **Nodes**: Individual components that perform specific tasks
- **Edges**: Connections that define the flow between nodes
