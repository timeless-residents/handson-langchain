# LangChain Agent: Language Translation Agent (Usecase-008)

This example demonstrates how to create a LangChain agent that performs sophisticated language translation tasks using multiple specialized chains.

## Overview

The agent uses OpenAI's language models with different temperature settings to handle various aspects of translation, from accurate text conversion to culturally nuanced explanations.

## Features

- Detect the language of input text
- Translate between multiple languages with high accuracy
- Adjust translation formality (formal vs informal)
- Provide cultural context and idiom explanations
- Suggest alternative expressions in the target language
- Summarize translated content

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key (set as environment variable)
- Required packages: see `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script demonstrates several translation-related queries:
- Language detection
- Basic translation with formality settings
- Idiom translation with cultural context
- Alternative expression suggestions
- Translation with summarization

## Tool Descriptions

1. **LanguageDetection**: Identifies the language of the provided text
2. **TextTranslation**: Translates text between languages with optional formality settings
3. **CulturalContext**: Provides cultural explanations for translated content
4. **AlternativeExpressions**: Suggests different ways to express the same meaning
5. **SummarizeTranslation**: Creates a concise version of the translated text

## Input Formats

Each tool requires specific input formatting:

- **LanguageDetection**: Plain text input
- **TextTranslation**: `text|source language|target language|[formal/informal]`
- **CulturalContext**: `original text|translated text|source language|target language`
- **AlternativeExpressions**: `translated text|target language`
- **SummarizeTranslation**: `text|target language`

## LLM Strategy

The agent uses two different LLM configurations:
- `translator_llm` (temperature=0.1): For precise tasks like translation and summarization
- `creative_llm` (temperature=0.7): For more creative tasks like cultural explanations and alternatives

## Customization

- Add support for more languages by extending the prompts
- Implement specialized chains for specific language pairs
- Add domain-specific translation (legal, medical, technical)
- Implement terminology consistency checks
- Add support for translating entire documents

## Limitations

- Quality depends on the underlying LLM's language capabilities
- No support for very low-resource languages
- Limited handling of highly technical or specialized content
- No long-term memory of terminology preferences
- Lacks integration with professional translation tools

## Next Steps

To enhance this translation agent, consider:
- Implementing terminology databases for consistency
- Adding translation memory to reuse previous translations
- Supporting document-level translation with formatting preservation
- Implementing quality estimation metrics
- Adding language pair-specific fine-tuning
