# Use Case 015: Tool Use in LangGraph

This use case demonstrates how to integrate external tools into a LangGraph application, enabling the agent to interact with external systems and data sources.

## Overview

Building on previous use cases, this example introduces:

1. Tool integration within LangGraph
2. Dynamic tool selection
3. Tool result handling and state updates
4. Multi-step reasoning with tools

## Implementation

This implementation shows a research agent that can:
1. Identify what information is needed
2. Select appropriate tools to gather that information
3. Process tool results to improve its understanding
4. Generate a comprehensive response based on tool outputs

Available tools include:
- Weather data retrieval (simulated)
- Wikipedia information lookup (simulated) 
- Calculator for mathematical operations
- Calendar for date-based information

## Requirements

```
langgraph>=0.0.10
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.0.2
```

## Usage

```python
python main.py "What's the relationship between atmospheric pressure and rainfall?"
```

## Key Concepts

- **Tool Integration**: Incorporating external capabilities into the graph
- **Tool Selection**: Dynamically choosing tools based on needs
- **Result Processing**: Handling and integrating tool outputs
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Using tools across multiple steps of analysis
