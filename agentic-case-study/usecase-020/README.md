# Use Case 020: Advanced State Management in LangGraph

This use case demonstrates advanced state management techniques in LangGraph to handle complex workflows with rich state transformations.

## Overview

This example shows how to:
1. Implement complex state structures
2. Manage state history and versioning
3. Use typed state with validation
4. Implement state checkpointing and recovery

## Implementation

The implementation shows a document editing system that:
- Maintains document version history
- Tracks changes across editing sessions
- Provides undo/redo functionality
- Manages document metadata

## Requirements

```
langgraph>=0.0.10
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.0.2
pydantic>=2.0.0
```

## Usage

```python
python main.py "Create a report on climate change mitigation strategies"
```

## Key Concepts

- **Rich State**: Complex state objects with nested properties
- **State History**: Tracking changes over time
- **Immutable Updates**: Making safe state transformations
- **Type Validation**: Ensuring state consistency
