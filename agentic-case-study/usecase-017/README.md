# Use Case 017: Human-in-the-Loop with LangGraph

This use case demonstrates how to integrate human interaction within a LangGraph workflow.

## Overview

This example shows how to:
1. Create pause points for human input
2. Incorporate human feedback into the processing
3. Allow human override of agent decisions
4. Implement approval workflows

## Implementation

The implementation shows a content generation system where:
- An agent proposes content
- A human can approve, reject, or modify the proposal
- The final result incorporates human feedback

## Requirements

```
langgraph>=0.0.10
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-openai>=0.0.2
```

## Usage

```python
python main.py "Write a short blog post about sustainable gardening"
```

## Key Concepts

- **Human Checkpoints**: Points where human input is required
- **Feedback Integration**: Using human feedback to improve results
- **Approval Workflow**: Structured process for content review
- **Interactive Agents**: Combining AI and human intelligence
